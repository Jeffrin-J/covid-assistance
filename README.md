# covid_assistant

### Description
```
The basic idea behind our project is it helps the people  to locate the hospitals that 
are available near by them using their current GPS location An user can even request 
for beds through our web portal to any hospital that has vacant beds on the other end 
hospitals can respond to the users request that is they can either reject or accept 
the patient's request In case if the patient's request was not addressed by the 
hospital members within one day portal will take help of social media like twitter 
to seek for help by posting the details of the patient.
